# LocationFinder

Match point-locations to polygonal regions and output which locations fall into each region as JSON.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Scala CLI** (for Scala 3 support and dependency management)  
  [Get Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

## How to Run

### 1. Run with Input Files

From the project root, run:

```sh
scala-cli run . -- \
  --regions=input/regions.json \
  --locations=input/locations.json \
  --output=output/results.json
run . tells Scala CLI to compile and run the app from src/.

-- separates Scala CLI flags from your appâ€™s flags.

--regions: path to regions JSON

--locations: path to locations JSON

--output: path to write results JSON

Results will be written to output/results.json.

2. Run with Built-in Demo Data
To quickly try the app with built-in example data, run:


scala-cli run . -- --demo
This uses a sample region (a square) and three locations (inside, on the edge, and outside).

By default, results print to console.

To write demo results to a file:

scala-cli run . -- --demo --output=output/demo-results.json
Output Format
Results are a JSON array like:

[
  {
    "region": "DemoBox",
    "matched_locations": [
      "Inside",
      "OnEdge"
    ]
  }
]
Running Tests
To run all tests (point-in-polygon, region-matching, JSON round-trip):

scala-cli test .
